A more advanced implementation of Pi Coin that incorporates several features found in modern blockchain networks. This implementation will include advanced concepts like a decentralized network, consensus algorithm, merkle trees, and more sophisticated smart contracts.

This advanced implementation includes:

A more sophisticated Transaction class with digital signatures.
A MerkleTree class for efficient transaction verification.
An improved Block class with Merkle root.
Abstract SmartContract class with two example contracts: TokenSwapContract and StakingContract.
A PiNetwork class with advanced features like node management, consensus, and smart contract execution.
A Wallet class for key management and transaction signing.
Asynchronous network simulation.

This implementation demonstrates several advanced blockchain concepts:

Merkle trees for efficient transaction verification
Digital signatures for transaction authentication
Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism
Smart contracts for automated, trustless operations
Basic token swapping and staking functionality
Network node management and conflict resolution
